# CS190 Lab 1 - Introduction to CS190 #

The purpose of this lab is to explain what CS190 is, signup for github, go over the syllabus, join the CS190 Piazza, and if you want, take Quiz 1.

## GitHub ##

GitHub is an open-source code sharing platform. It let's anyone upload their code to share with the world. GitHub is also a lot more than just that, but we'll go over that later in the semester when we talk more specifically about git.

We're going to use GitHub throughout the semester to share the labs with you. Every lab will have a README (which is really just a file, README.md), which will outline the labs instructions. Just like this one!


### Creating a Student GitHub Account

GitHub gives all students free education accounts. This gives you extra free private repositories.

To get a student account, go to https://education.github.com and follow the steps there.

After you've done this, be sure to give your TA your GitHub username.

### Syllabus ###

To help you get a little more familiar with git and the terminal, we're going to have you clone the course syllabus.

*Cloning in GitHub simply copies a repository (collection of files) to your computer.*

1. Go to the [Syllabus](https://github.com/PurdueCS190/syllabus).

2. Copy the Clone URL under the HTTPS clone URL label (right side of page).

3. Open up terminal and type command, replacing <GitHub Clone URL> with the URL that you copied.

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/cs190
    git clone <GitHub Clone URL> ~/cs190/syllabus
    ```

    > Note: In this course, whenever you see `<your school>` that means that you should replace everything inside of and including the carets. So `echo <your school> is awesome` would become `echo Purdue is awesome`

4. View the syllabus! To do this, just open this folder (~/cs190/lab1) in the file navigator and double click on `syllabus.html`
