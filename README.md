# CS190 Lab 1 - Introduction to CS190 #

The purpose of this lab is to explain what CS190 is, signup for github, go over the syllabus, join the CS190 Piazza, and if you want, take Quiz 1.

## GitHub ##

GitHub is an open-source code sharing platform. It let's anyone upload their code to share with the world. GitHub is also a lot more than just that, but we'll go over that later in the semester when we talk more specifically about git.

We're going to use GitHub throughout the semester to share the labs with you. Every lab will have a README (which is really just a file, README.md), which will outline the labs instructions. Just like this one!

### Syllabus ###

To help you get a little more familiar with git and the terminal, we're going to have you clone the course syllabus.

*Cloning in GitHub simply copies a repository (collection of files) to your computer.*

1. Go to the [Syllabus](https://github.com/PurdueCS190/syllabus).

2. Copy the Clone URL under the HTTPS clone URL label (right side of page).

3. In your home directory, type the terminal command, replacing <GitHub Clone URL> with the URL that you copied.

    ```bash
    git clone <GitHub Clone URL> ~/cs190lab1
    ```

4. Open the syllabus!

## Piazza ##

Piazza is where we'll post all course announcements (deadlines, extensions, etc) and have general discussions.

1. Go to the [CS190 Piazza](https://piazza.com/purdue/cs190/home).

2. Create an account if you haven't already.

3. Join the class!

## Quiz 1 (optional) ##

There will be bi-weekly quizzes. If you want to get a head start on the first one do it during lab!

1. Go to [blackboard](https://mycourses.purdue.edu).

2. Login with your career account.

3. Go to Fall-2014-CS-19000-TLE under "My Courses."
